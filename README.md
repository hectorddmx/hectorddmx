### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm **HÃ©ctor De Diego Brito**.   

- I'm an iOS, macOS, tvOS developer. Proficient in both Swift and Objective-C.  
- In my free time I do some projects with Elixir/Phoenix (PETAL Stack), Python/Django and Dart/Flutter which are stacks I enjoy a lot.  
- In the past I did PHP/Laravel, Unity3d/C# and a couple of PoC's with Angular and React but I'm either rusty, not very good at them and/or don't enjoy working with those technologies anymore.  
- I'd love to see XR technologies (glasess or projectors) and IOT change the landscape of technology in the next years.

About me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as the Global Head of the Mobile Department at Distillery.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Phoenix Live View and Surface to design reusable components.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on IOT and XR projects. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help organizing meetups.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything about iOS!
