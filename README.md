### Hi there 👋 

I'm **Héctor De Diego Brito**.   

- I'm an iOS, macOS, tvOS developer. Proficient in both Swift and Objective-C.  
- In my free time I do some projects with Elixir/Pheonix (PETAL Stack) and Python/Django which are stacks I enjoy a lot.  
- In the past I did PHP/Laravel, Unity3d/C# and a couple of PoC's with Angular and React but I'm rusty and/or don't enjoy working with those technologies anymore.  
- I'd love to see XR technologies (glasess or projectors) and IOT change the landscape of technology in the next years.

About me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working as the Global Head of Department in Distillery.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Phoenix Live View and Surface to design reusable components.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on IOT and XR projects. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help doing or organization meetups.
- 💬 Ask me anything about iOS!
